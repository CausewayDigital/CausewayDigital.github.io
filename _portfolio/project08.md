Go deeper into cybersecurity and build digital fluency and cyber skills with topics like encryption and social engineering. Witness the effects of malware and learn techniques to combat it. Cyber Expert covers encryption/decryption, message integrity, DoS/DDoS attacks, Malware and Ransomware. Itâ€™s not just about warding off attacks but understanding the why and how. Protect against digital chaos, learn how to identify and remediate impacted systems, and explore career connections in cyber. 
   
  
Working with Florida International University over a 9-12 month period, Causeway Digital took their vision and produced 3 standards aligned worlds that cover a number of the more advanced topics within cybersecurity. This involved working within a number of stakeholders to cover the requirements within the grant, while also building training materials to support educators within Florida to deliver the content within their classrooms.
The project was funded by a grant through the *"Cybersecurity and Information Technology Pathways Program"*, lead by Florida Department of Education. 
   
The lesson and educator materials can be downloaded from the [Minecraft Education world library](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/discover/cyber-and-digital-safety/cyber-expert).
