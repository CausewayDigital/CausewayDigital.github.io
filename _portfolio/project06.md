Can you help the Wildlife Park build an AI based feeding system? Learn how an AI is only as good as the data it's trained with.  
This world and lesson materials were commissioned by the Mozilla Foundation as part of YouthZone at Mozilla Festival 2023.   
   
  
Working with the Mozilla Foundation, Causeway Digital helped the foundation navigate the complex environment of Minecraft, allowing them to reach a new audience that they may not have otherwise been able to reach. The award winning content was developed for a young audience (ages 8-13) and provides a foundation in what AI is and more importantly, how the data you use to train your AI can impact the outcomes, for better or for worse.   
  
The content was awarded a [Silver award](https://www.anthemawards.com/winners/list/entry/#!responsible-technology/digital-innovative-experiences/mozilla-festival-ai-wildlife-park/1972/-1/528731) in the 2024 Anthem Awards under the Digital & Innovative Experiences category.
   
The lesson and educator materials can be downloaded from the [Minecraft Education world library](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/lessons/ai-wildlife-park).
