This 2-3 hour activity will bring a class of students on a coding adventure. Initially beginning on the high seas, with Captain Pappert, the students will eventually find themselves shipwrecked on Seymour Island.
After sneaking into the town (through the town sewers), students find themselves tasked with fixing a number of issues that have arisen around the town.
These 8 tasks range from basic agent movement, to conditionals and loops, with students receiving a point on the leaderboard for each completed.
The tasks are available to students in MakeCode Blocks or MakeCode Python, with some tasks also requiring them to collaborate with other students.

The lesson can be downloaded from the [Minecraft Education Edition world library](https://education.minecraft.net/lessons/seymour-island).
