Welcome to the Kingdom of the Floating Islands. This mystical kingdom floats high above the world below. Throughout this collection of 6 lessons, students will learn the basics of Python, through a series of themed tasks in each world. Completing these tasks will allow the kingdom to develop further technologically.
Aimed at KS3 students, these lessons cover everything from input/outputs, to conditional statements, loops and right up to lists.
