MusicCrafter transforms Minecraft into a collaborative musical playground. With six playable instruments, players can compose, save, and perform custom songs directly in-gameâ€”solo or with friends. The synchronized play mode lets groups jam together in real time, making it easy to create anything from catchy tunes to full symphonies. Seamlessly compatible with any world, MusicCrafter is a fun and innovative tool for both casual play and serious musical expression.
  
   
The add-on can be downloaded from Minecraft Marketplace in-game or from the [Minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/causeway-digital/musiccrafter-add--on/055e53c5-4824-4aad-979f-16fccd5bf388).
