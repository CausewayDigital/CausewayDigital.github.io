This extensive guide covers the full range of commands available to students within the Azure Notebooks Python API, within Minecraft Education.   
Each command includes one or multiple examples that students can easily run within the game, along with detailed explanations of the available parameters.   

The Reference Guide was developed to allow students to take Python in Minecraft further, to give them the tools to create their own complex programs.   

Alongside the Reference Guide, Python Islands 7 was added with 6 new activities that are written in such a way as to encourage students to make use of the reference guide in developing their solutions.   

The reference guide can be accessed here - [https://aka.ms/pyguide](https://aka.ms/pyguide)
