## Binary Springs
After a power cut in the town of Binary Springs, the player must check up on all the enbedded computers across the town. This involves discovering computers in everything from train ticket machines, games consoles and even bank ATMs.

## Circuit Central
Computer chips can be found in all our modern devices, but not all devices were created equal. In this world, the player is provided with a number of scenarios and a fixed budget for each with the task of buying the needed devices with at at least the minimum specification.
